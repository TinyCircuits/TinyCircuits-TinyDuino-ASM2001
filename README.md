# TinyCircuits TinyDuino Processor Board
# ASM2001 Rev6

These are the design files for the TinyCircuits ASM2001 Rev 6 PCB.  This is a Tiny processor board (Square Version, 20mm x 20mm, or Circular 20mm diameter) that uses the same microcontroller (Atmel Atmega328P) as the Arduino Uno and has stackable TinyShield support.  

Format is in Cadsoft Eagle format - Eagle version 6.2 was used for the original design.

This project uses designs and concepts developed as part of the Arduino project and the LilyPad project.  The TinyCircuits design files themselves (schematics, PCB and libraries) are not directly derived from these works' design files and have been created new, however the concepts and basic architecture behind the TinyDuino and TinyLily products are derived and we thank the hard work of the organizations below for their contributions to open-source hardware:
